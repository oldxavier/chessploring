# This will be the main running script for a chess game.
# First implementation won't have any GUI, that is a
# completely different coding effort that can be done
# after the engine is working sufficiently.

# Initialise chess board, move stack, etc.

# Ask for move input, if empty, "simulate"

# Continue doing so until checkmate or stalemate or draw by not sufficient material or repetition
